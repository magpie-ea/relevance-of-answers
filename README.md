# Relevance of Answers

This repository contains code and data for an investigation into which of different notions of (Bayesian and information-theoretic) relevance best predict human judgements of an answer's helpfulness.

For detailed information about each subpart of the project, consult the `README.md` file contained in each subdirectory.

- `analysis` contains all code related to data analysis
- `experiment` contains the code for the experiment
- `plotting` contains code for additional plotting (on top of what is inside `analysis`) 
- `qualitative-analysis` contains code supporting the exploratory qualitative analysis on top of `analysis`
- `results` contains the data from the runs of the experiment
