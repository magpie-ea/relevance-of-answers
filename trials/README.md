- there are 12 vignettes (column: StimID)
- each vignette is realized 21 times in order to realize each of the 21 different conditions
- a condition is a triple consisting of a `AnswerCertainty`, `AnswerPolarity` and `ContextType`
  + `AnswerCertainty` has 3 levels: `high_certainty`, `low_certainty` and `non_answer`
  + `AnswerPolarity` has 2 levels: `negative` and `positive` (it is undefined for `non_answer`s)
  + `ContextType` has 3 levels: `negative`, `neutral` and `positive`
- each participant sees 10 trials, 
  + each trial shows a different vignette in random order
  + each participant sees four `high_certainty` and four `low_certainty` trials, as well as two `non_answer` trials
  + the four `high_certainty` trials are realized as two `negative` and two `positive` instances of `AnswerPolarity`; same for `low_certainty`; (there is no variation in this variable for `non_answer` trials)
  + the variable `ContextType` is randomly assigned on each trial


# notes
- don't mention preferences for chocolate bars; might influence judgements
- must mention that there are only two kinds of candy bars inside the bag
- how can you buy another 20 tickets if there are only 10 in the jar?
