But lately you have noticed some suspicious things about her habits. She is almost always the last to leave, but one time when you stayed to work late, you noticed her talking to a shady figure in the parking lot.

You ask your colleague Alan privately: **Is Lauren the mole?**

Alan responds: **She has weekly meetings with her phone turned off.**"
