This is a `dash` app that lets you make scatter plots with any first-order or second-order measure, and lets you filter the data, all using dropdown menus. You can also mouse over data points to see the stimulus text.

To use the app, install `dash` and `plotly` and just run the python script:
```bash
pip install dash plotly
python3 app.py
```
