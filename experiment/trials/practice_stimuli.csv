1,practice,prior,Your friend Aaron has gone to Paris on vacation. He's the kind of person who would rather sit in a cafe all day than go around visiting tourist sites. But he'll make an exception for the really unmissable sites.,You ask your friend Jess:,Will Aaron visit the Eiffel Tower?,Jess responds:,Aaron hates the Eiffel Tower.,Jess,How likely do you think it is that Aaron will visit the Eiffel Tower?,Aaron will visit the Eiffel Tower,highly unlikely,highly likely,"The Eiffel Tower seems like a pretty 'unmissable' site, so to a lot of people a probability between 50% and 90% seems reasonable.","In the case at hand, the probability is fairly hard to judge, so you may have low commitment to your judgment. Based on just this information, a high probability like 60% or 80% might be the best guess. But the context leaves open a strong possibility that a low probability like 40% or even 10% is more appropriate (for example, if Aaron doesn't consider the Eiffel tower 'unmissable'). So maybe you could select a button on the lower end, like 1, 2, or 3."
1,practice,posterior,Your friend Aaron has gone to Paris on vacation. He's the kind of person who would rather sit in a cafe all day than go around visiting tourist sites. But he'll make an exception for the really unmissable sites.,You ask your friend Jess:,Will Aaron visit the Eiffel Tower?,Jess responds:,Aaron hates the Eiffel Tower.,Jess,"How likely do you think it is now, after hearing Jess's response, that Aaron will visit the Eiffel Tower?",Aaron will visit the Eiffel Tower,highly unlikely,highly likely,"It's pretty unlikely that Aaron will go to the Eiffel Tower if he hates it. So select a low probability, like 5%.","You might be more committed than before that the probability is very low, like 1% or 5%. Other similar probabilities like 2% or 10% are plausible, but very different probabilities like 60% or 80% are unreasonable. So select a button that's higher than before, like 4, 5, or 6."

But he'll make an exception for the really unmissable sites.,You ask your friend Jess:,Will Aaron visit the Eiffel Tower?,Jess responds:,Aaron hates the Eiffel Tower.,Jess,How helpful was Jess's response to the question at hand?,Aaron will visit the Eiffel Tower,completely unhelpful,maximally helpful,"Jess's answer doesn't directly answer the question, but you would probably find it pretty relevant in this context because it tells you something new about whether Aaron will go to the Eiffel Tower. So move the slider towards the right and select a value between 40 and 90."

So move the slider towards the right and select a value between 50 and 75."

This time you would probably have guessed that Aaron would avoid the Eiffel Tower, even if you didn't specifically know that he hated it.
