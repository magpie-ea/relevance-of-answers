# Relevance of Answers ::: Experiment

This directory contains the code for an online experiment to test different notions of (Bayesian and information-theoretic) relevance against human judgements of an answer's helpfulness.

A live version is [here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/relevance-of-answers/experiment/).

The experiment uses [_magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org).
Clone the repository and set up the project with `npm install`.
To run the experiment locally, run `npm run serve`.
