# README for `plotting` directory

This directory contains a few scripts for `python`-based plotting in `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

It's not clear if any of these plots will get used. 
We also have several plotting functions in `R` in the `analysis` directory 
in the `data-exploration-writeup.Rmd` file.
